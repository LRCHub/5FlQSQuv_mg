I'm at a pay phone tryin' to call home,
all of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone,
baby it's all wrong, where are the plans
we made for two
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember,
the people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it,
but is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted,
all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights,
you turned out the lights, now I'm paralyzed,
still stuck in that time,
when we called it love, but even the sun sets
in paradise
I'm at a pay phone tryin' to call home,
all of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone,
baby it's all wrong, where are the plans
we made for two
If happy ever after did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow,
but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine,
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before,
but all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights,
you turned out the lights, now I'm paralyzed,
still stuck in that time,
when we called it love, but even the sun sets
in paradise
I'm at a pay phone tryin' to call home,
all of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone,
baby it's all wrong, where are the plans
we made for two
If happy ever after did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a pay phone
(Wiz)
Man fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
while you're sittin' round wondering
why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom now
when you see me I'm stunnin'
And all of my cars start
with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show,
you can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could of got picked
Had a really good game
but you missed your last shot, so you talk
about who you see at the top
or what you could of saw but sad to
say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away got what you was lookin for
Now it's me who they want
so you can go and take that little piece
of shit with you
(Adam)
Yeah, I'm at a pay phone tryin' to call home,
all of my change I spent
on you
Where have the times gone,
baby it's all wrong, where are the plans
we made for two
If happy ever after did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairy tales are full of shit
Yeah, one more fucking love song I'll be sick
